<h1 align='right'><a name='INTRO'>Introduction</a></h1>

<p>This document describes how to use the HTMLDOC software,
version 1.9. HTMLDOC converts Hyper-Text Markup Language
("HTML") input files into indexed HTML, Adobe&reg;
PostScript&reg;, or Adobe Portable Document Format ("PDF")
files.</p>

<p>HTMLDOC supports most HTML 4.01 elements, CSS1 and some CSS2
stylesheet properties, and can generate title, table of contents,
and index pages.</p>

<p>HTMLDOC can be used as a standalone application, in a batch
document processing environment, or as a web-based report
generation application.</p>

<p>No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by
HTMLDOC.</p>

<p>HTMLDOC is available both as open source software under the
terms of the GNU General Public License and as commercial
software under the terms of a traditional commercial End-User
License Agreement.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Like many programs HTMLDOC was developed in response to a
need our company had for generating high-quality documentation
in printed and electronic forms. For a while we used
FrameMaker&reg; and a package from <code>sgi</code> that
generated "compiled" Standard Generalized Markup Language
("SGML") files that could be used by the Electronic Book
Technologies ("EBT") documentation products; EBT was bought by
INSO who was bought by Stellent<sup>TM</sup> who apparently has
dropped the whole product line. When <code>sgi</code> stopped
supporting these tools we turned to INSO, but the cost of their
tools is prohibitive to small businesses.</p>

<p>In the end we decided to write our own program to generate
our documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice
since WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and
at worst you can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output
for documentation on our web server, PDF for customers to read
and/or print from their computers, and PostScript for our own
printing needs.</p>

<p>The result of our efforts is the HTMLDOC software which is
available for Linux&reg;/UNIX&reg;, MacOS&reg; X, and
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other things, this software
users manual is produced using HTMLDOC.</p>
