REQUIREMENTS

    To compile HTMLDOC you'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++
    compilers (gcc is fine, most vendor compilers work, too). 
    The JPEG, PNG, and ZLIB libraries are provided with HTMLDOC.


COMPILING HTMLDOC UNDER WINDOWS

    For the Windows version we have included Visual C++.NET
    solution and project files under the "vcnet" directory. You
    must add the OpenSSL include and library directories to your
    VC++ environment options.


INSTALLING HTMLDOC UNDER WINDOWS

    If you want to install the software by hand, create a
    directory for the software and copy the HTMLDOC executable,
    the "fonts" directory, the "data" directory, and the "doc"
    directory to it.

    Then create the following registry entries with REGEDIT:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Easy Software Products\HTMLDOC\doc
	    = C:/install/dir/doc
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Easy Software Products\HTMLDOC\data
	    = C:/install/dir	


CONFIGURING HTMLDOC UNDER UNIX

    To compile the software under UNIX you just need to run the
    "configure" script in this directory.  Usually this is just:

        ./configure

    If you don't want to install HTMLDOC in the default
    directories (/usr/bin, /usr/man/man1, etc.), use the
    "--prefix" option when you run the configure script:

        ./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    If the OpenSSL library is in a non-standard location you can
    specify it using:

        ./configure --with-openssl-includes=/some/directory/include \
	    --with-openssl-libs=/some/directory/lib

    If you aren't using "cc" or "gcc" for your ANSI C compiler,
    you'll need to set the CC environment variable prior to
    running the configure script:

        CC=compiler; export CC

    for Bourne and Korn shells, and:

        setenv CC "compiler"

    for C shell.

    If you aren't using "gcc", "g++", "c++", or "CC" for your
    C++ compiler, you'll also need to set the CXX environment
    variable:

        CXX=compiler; export CXX

    for Bourne and Korn shells, and:

        setenv CXX "compiler"

    for C shell.


COMPILING HTMLDOC UNDER UNIX

    Just run "make" to build the software and generate the
    documentation.


INSTALLING HTMLDOC UNDER UNIX

    Run "make install" to install the software.
